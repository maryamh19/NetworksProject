# Router-on-a-Stick Network with Port Security and DHCP Snooping

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates a **secure multi-VLAN network** using a single router in a Router-on-a-Stick configuration. The network includes:

- **VLAN Segmentation:** Separate VLANs for logical isolation of devices.
- **Router-on-a-Stick:** Inter-VLAN routing via a single router interface.
- **DHCP:** Automated IP assignment per VLAN.
- **Port Security:** Limits unauthorized devices on access ports.
- **DHCP Snooping:** Protects against rogue DHCP servers and logs DHCP bindings.

This setup is ideal for small offices, co-working spaces, or lab environments where network security and scalability are important.
